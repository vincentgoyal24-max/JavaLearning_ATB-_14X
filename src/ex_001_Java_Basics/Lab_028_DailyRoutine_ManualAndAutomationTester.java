/*
Daily Routine of a Manual Tester

Morning Stand-up (Scrum Meeting)

Share yesterdayâ€™s progress, todayâ€™s plan, and blockers.

Get updates from developers and other QA teammates.

Check Emails & Updates

Look for new builds/releases deployed on QA or staging.

Review any bug status changes, developer comments, or Jira tickets assigned.

Review Requirements & Test Artifacts

Go through user stories, acceptance criteria, test cases, and check if anything new has come.

Update test cases or scenarios if requirements changed.

Test Execution

Perform functional, regression, integration, exploratory, or smoke testing.

Log bugs in Jira (or whichever tool is used) with proper steps and screenshots.

Re-test fixed bugs from previous builds.

Collaboration with Team

Discuss unclear requirements with Product Owner/BA.

Work closely with developers to reproduce issues or clarify defects.

Documentation

Update test case management tools (like QMetry, TestRail, Excel).

Write daily status reports or update Jira with testing progress.

End of the Day Wrap-up

Share daily progress with the team lead or update dashboards.

Make a note of pending items for the next day.

ðŸ¤– Daily Routine of an Automation Tester

(Has overlaps with manual but includes scripting and framework work)

Morning Stand-up (Scrum Meeting)

Same as manual tester: updates, blockers, planning.

Check Automation Jobs

Look at CI/CD pipeline results (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.).

Analyze failed test cases to find whether failures are due to script issues, environment issues, or real defects.

Requirement Analysis

Review new features/user stories and decide what should be automated.

Discuss with manual testers/developers which scenarios are high priority for automation.

Test Script Development

Write or enhance automation scripts (using Java + Selenium, TestNG, JUnit, etc.).

Maintain framework (update libraries, refactor code, add utility functions).

Execution & Debugging

Run automation suites (smoke, regression, API tests).

Debug scripts, handle failures, and make them stable.

Collaboration with Manual Testers

Take reusable manual test cases and convert them into automation scripts.

Share automation coverage reports with QA team.

Reporting & Documentation

Publish test execution results (via Extent Reports, Allure, Jenkins reports).

Track automation coverage % vs. manual coverage.

End of the Day Wrap-up

Push code to version control (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

Update Jira or test management tool with automation progress.

ðŸ”‘ Key Difference

Manual Tester â†’ More focused on exploratory execution, finding defects, and requirement understanding.

Automation Tester â†’ More focused on framework maintenance, writing scripts, debugging, and running automated suites.
